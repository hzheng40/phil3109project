Choosing the perfect location is crucial to reaching your platinum quota of 100 tons. If the crew begins mining where platinum levels are low, the mine may never produce sufficient yields. Conversely, if they spend too much time searching, they may not have enough time to harvest.

<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Mining Prospect #1" tags="" position="504,466">After 5 earth-days of fruitless searching, the crew finds a possible mine location. The platinum levels there are lower than expected, but mining operations should have begun by now. The mining expert recommends that the crew keep searching for a better mine, but he&#39;s outvoted by the other three members who are eager to begin mining.

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="mine at this location" tags="" position="379,591">The mining is arduous and the land is laden with unusable sediment, but, slowly and surely, platinum is harvested. The crew exhausts themselves working 14 and 16 hour shifts to make up for lost time. As the launch date for the return voyage approaches, it becomes clear that the mission will only harvest some 70 tons out of the 100 tons expected.

<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Mine Prospect #2" tags="" position="654,616">The very next day, the crew discovers incredibly platinum rich soil to which they begin moving equipment immediately. The quota of 100 tons is doubled by only the 4th day of mining. Spirits are high and most of the crew is eager to continue mining. The exception to this excitement is the pilot who, although similarly thrilled by the success, has expressed concern that the spacecraft will be sacrificing some maneuverability when carrying extreme levels of mass. However, he concedes that the craft undoubtedly has enough fuel to return to Earth.

<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="2 days before launch date" tags="" position="325,824">As the launch date approaches, the crew is frustrated by the lack of success. They unanimously suggest to you that one of them ought to go back to the mining site to make a last round of inspections on the equipment. The purpose of the inspection would be for the benefit of a follow up mission in the case that we one day return for all the platinum which they believe they are leaving behind. Because the time for launch is less than 24 hours a day, the entire crew would ideally be on board the ship preparing for the return voyage.

<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="continue harvesting platinum" tags="" position="654,766">The crew has continued success in their platinum mines. The equipment runs without issue and the space craft is loaded to the brim with the precious metal. They estimate that they&#39;ve loaded 700 tons, 7 times the quota of the mission. The crew, along with the entire workforce at headquarters, is ecstatic!

<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="order the crew to cease mining operations" tags="" position="804,766">Despite the 200 tons of platinum loaded onto the spacecraft, your crew, even the pilot, is agitated because of their desire for more. Indeed, even personell at headquarters have expressed their frustration with you personally for holding back profits. The crew passes time on board the craft performing trivial experiments in the low gravity field of the asteroid.

<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="order the entire crew to remain on board the space craft" tags="" position="733,1042">12 hours before the scheduled time for launch, you receive a red alert about a solar radiation storm. These storms occur when the sun undergoes a major magnetic eruption and showers a region of space with protons. Historically, radiation has caused major circuitry failures on space crafts. Your instruments tell you that you have roughly an hour before the storm hits.

Fortunately you have all men on board the craft and an immediate launch will likely return everyone back to Earth safely.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="next" tags="" position="723,901">The crew unanimously requests that you approve a last minute mission. They suggest that one of them ought to go back to the mining site to make a last round of inspections on the equipment.

Your instruments tell you that you have roughly an hour before the storm hits.

Usually, you would order an immediate launch, but presently you have a man inspecting the mining equipment dozens of miles away. He does not have the time to return to the ship before the launch.</tw-passagedata>
