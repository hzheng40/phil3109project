The only chance of escape is your space craft which will likely be compromised if it remains in the afflicted region. You&#39;re pilot instructs you that your man on the surface has been instructed to travel down into the mine where he will be safe from radiation.

His jeopardy is only temporarily delayed, however, as his ship is his only chance of returning to Earth.

A decision must be made. Shall the ship attempt to endure the storm or will your man be left on the planet alone.

(if the ship contains 700 tons of platinum)

Your analysts confirm what everybody has already suspected. The ship does not have the fuel to return to the asteroid for an additional launch.

[[attempt rescue mission-&gt;rescue failure]]
[[abandon rescue mission-&gt;towards earth w/o rescue attempt]]

(if the ship contains 200 tons with 90% or greater ship quality)

Your analysts are deeply concerned about the risks of the return journey. The extra weight of the platinum will make the space craft very difficult to maneuver with a possibility of running out of fuel.

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="order ship to remain on asteroid" tags="" position="942,571">(if the crew has sent the man on the mining inspection mission against your order)

The crew and the personell at headquarters wait both anxiously and solemnly as the storm overthrows the asteroid. Communications are lost as the radiation washes over (78)-Dorado in an impermeable haze. Waiting in silence is your only option.

(if the crew sent the man on the mining inspection mission on account of your order (700 or 200 tons of platinum on board))

The crew and the personell at headquarters are immensely uneasy. In addition to their deep concern for the man left on the asteroid, they have begun to question your competency. Presently, everyone waits in silence for the storm to pass. Communications have been temporarily lost on account of the radiation.

(if the crew sent the man on the mining inspection mission on account of your order (70 tons of platinum on board))

The crew is furious with your decisions. You can not help but overhear serious discussion by your superiors at headquarters of you being immediately deposed of your position as head of operations for this mission. Presently, everyone waits in silence for the storm to pass. Communications have been temporarily lost on account of the radiation.

If it has 200 tons he will inform you that the rescue will mission be risky. If the ship has 70 tons, he will recommend a rescue journey.)

The families of the astronauts are contacted and brought into headquarters so that goodbyes may be said.

The crew intends to make a desperate attempt to escape. However, due to the severity of the damage, nobody expects the space craft to even leave the surface.

<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="rescue failure" tags="" position="484,855">The crew lands on the asteroid. As the man on the surface travels back to the craft, the crew inspects the viability of the return launch.

It quickly becomes evident that the craft does not contain adequate fuel for the return journey. The families of the astronauts are contacted and brought into headquarters so that goodbyes may be said.

The crew intends to make a desperate effort to return back towards earth. They will almost certainly exhaust their fuel supply and float off into the depths of space.</tw-passagedata>
